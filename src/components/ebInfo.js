                PAPER: Includes reports on research, developments, and
                examinations in the specific fields shown in the category list,
                as detailed below, the contents of which may advance the
                development of science and industry:
              </p>
              <p>
                (1) Reports on new theories, experiments with new content, or
                extensions of and supplements to conventional theories and
                experiments.
              </p>
              <p>
                (2) Reports on developments in measurement technology and
                various applied technologies.
              </p>
              <p>
                (3) Reports on the planning, design, manufacture, testing, or
                operation of facilities, machinery, parts, materials, and
                others.
              </p>
              <p>
                (4) Presentation of new methods, suggestion of new angles,
                ideas, systematization, software, or any new facts regarding the
                above (1) to (3).
              </p>
              <p>
                SURVEY PAPER: Includes the following, targeting the same range
                and content as those in PAPER:
              </p>
              <p>
                (5) Reports that reflect a set understanding of the field
                involved, and effectively respond to inquiries from researchers
                or other involved parties about the significance of the field.
                In short, reports that support entries by new researchers,
                development by on-site researchers and applications by involved
                parties in that field.
              </p>
              <p>
                (6) Reports that differ from tutorials (explanatory articles
                appearing in journals) in that they demand a high caliber of
                technical knowledge. In short, reports that envision readers as
                specialists in the field, place their focus on the
                classification of existing documents, provide overviews of the
                field, evaluate the latest trends and cover other areas in that
                field.
              </p>
              <p>
                (7) Reports targeting major and large-scale fields (areas in
                which numerous readers have an interest) that effectively
                develop a basic framework or overall image of that field. In
                short, summary introductions that will hopefully encourage new
                research and otherwise supply readers with high-level
                assessments of the field, while systematically presenting
                existing research from a set perspective.

                POSITION PAPER: Articles with at least one of the following
                features and potentially having a significant influence on the
                theory and practice of communication technology.
              </p>
              <p>
                (8) Introduction of novel viewpoints, frameworks, and/or
                paradigms
              </p>
              <p>
                (9) Proposal of technologies or methods based on innovative
                ideas (not simply extensions of existing technologies)
              </p>
              <p>
                (10) Novel ideas with the potential to bring about innovative
                technologies
              </p>
              <p>
                (11) Prototypes or experimental results with noteworthy
                features, such as achievement of the world&#39;s best
                performance or the world&#39;s first realization
              </p>
              <p>
                Comprehensive evaluations of the proposed viewpoints,
                frameworks, paradigms, or ideas are not necessarily required. In
                view of this criterion, POSITION PAPERs are assumed to be
                shorter (around 6 pages) than PAPERs (standard number of pages
                is 8), although there is no restriction on the number of pages.

              <p>
                Upload a PDF file (limit: 10 MB) for review and editable
                electronic files (limit: 10 MB per file) for publishing in
                accordance with the instructions. If the file size exceeds the
                limit, please contact the IEICE Transactions Section. Authors
                who would like to include their Open Researcher and Contributor
                ID (ORCID) in the published manuscript are required to upload
                the following item (as one of the editable electronic files):
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  a text file named &quot;ORCID.txt&quot; containing a list of
                  the name and ORCID of each author in the following format:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Name of author 1, ORCID of author 1</li>
                    <li>Name of author 2, ORCID of author 2</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <hr />
              <p>
                Note that ORCID will not be included in advance publication
                articles.
              </p>
              <p>
                The article processing charge will be calculated in accordance
                with the format (LaTeX or Word) of the electronic source files.
                Electronic source files using the IEICE LaTeX style file will
                result in a lower article processing charge for the author(s)
                than will those using the Word format. Because the author(s)
                cannot alter the files once a &quot;Receipt of Manuscript&quot;
                e-mail is sent, using the IEICE LaTeX style file at the time of
                submission is recommended to those author(s) who desire a lower
                article processing charges.

              </p>
              <p>
                The author(s) must agree to the &quot;Copyright Transfer and
                Article Processing Charge Agreement&quot; by clicking the
                checkbox on the &quot;Manuscript Registration Form.&quot;

                The standard number of pages is 8 for a PAPER and 2 for a

                submission of a PAPER is 15 and that of a WRITTEN DISCUSSION is
                4. One page has approximately 900 words. If the authors would
                like to submit a PAPER, which exceeds the maximum number of
                pages for the initial submission, they must obtain permission
                from the Editorial board of the journal before submitting the
                manuscript. The Editorial Board does not accept any overlength
                requests about WRITTIN DISCUSSION.

                The LaTeX style file provided by the IEICE allows you to produce
                a manuscript virtually identical to the final published version.
                If you prepare your manuscript using the LaTeX style file, the
                article processing charge will be lower. Please refer to the
                description of the style file for details.

                The MS-Word template file provided by the IEICE allows you to
                produce a manuscript close to the final published version.
                Please note however that the page charge will be higher if you
                use the MS-Word template file.

                Submit a PDF file of the manuscript created by converting the
                manuscript prepared using the IEICE LaTeX style (ver. 2.2 for
                PLaTeX2E recommended) to PDF. This PDF file will be referred to
                in the preparation of the final published version. In the case
                of a manuscript submitted after a conditional acceptance, the
                revised parts must not be highlighted in the PDF file of the
                manuscript to be included in the editable electronic files.
                Diagrams created in the LaTeX environment, as well as figures
                produced electronically and then imported into the text in EPS
                or other format, must be output as they are. In the case of
                diagrams that cannot be thus imported into the text, enter the
                diagram number at the appropriate point in the text, along with
                the caption, leaving enough space for the diagram. Then, in the
                margin of the PDF file of the manuscript, enter the number of
                the diagram to be inserted. When submitting the electronic data
                of the manuscript and accompanying diagrams, please keep the
                following in mind:
              </p>
              <p>
                (a) Attach a LaTeX source file used to produce the PDF file of
                the manuscript in (1). There is no need for figures and such
                imported in EPS format to be deleted from the source.
                Nonetheless, be sure to attach the EPS file of the relevant
                figures in order to prevent errors during compilation.
              </p>
              <p>
                (b) Save figures and photographs in EPS format. No EPS file is
                required for figures created using LaTeX functions such as the
                Picture environment, Pictex, and Epic.
              </p>
              <p>
                (c) Insert tables directly in the source file of the text using
                the LaTeX table environment. Tables created using other software
                can be imported into the text in EPS or other format, in which
                case an EPS file of the relevant tables must be attached.
              </p>
              <p>
                (d) The minimum line width for figures and photographs in the
                final published version is 0.1 mm; please keep the scale ratio
                in mind when preparing your manuscript. If preparing figures or
                photographs in an application that does not allow you to adjust
                the line width numerically, do not use the smallest line width.

                file will be referred to in the preparation of the final

                highlighted in the PDF file of the manuscript to be included in
                the editable electronic files. In the case of diagrams that
                cannot be imported into the text, enter the number of the
                diagram at the appropriate point in the text and leave enough
                space for the diagram. Then, in the margin of the PDF file of
                the manuscript, enter the number of the diagram to be inserted.
                Manuscripts prepared using the MS-Word template are converted to
                LaTeX format at the editing company. When preparing the data,
                therefore, please keep the following in mind.

                (c) Save photographs in EPS format. In the case of photographs
                saved in PICT format, a resolution of around 300 dpi is
                recommended.
              </p>
              <p>
                (d) For tables, save just the contents of each table in text
                file format, deleting information on layout such as lines and
                borders. Lay out the contents as in the original table.

              <p>
                (e) Save all data for figures, photographs, and tables together
                in a single folder separate from the file containing the main
                text. Moreover, in an appropriately named text file, save the
                name (version) of the software used to create the figures and
                photographs, along with the names of the fonts used.
              </p>
              <p>
                (f) During the preparation of your manuscript, remember that the
                minimum line width that can be used for figures and photographs
                in the final published version is 0.1 mm. If using an
                application that does not allow you to adjust the line width
                numerically, do not use the smallest line width.

                About 6-7 weeks prior to publication, authors will be asked only

              </h3>
              <p>
                Upon acceptance for publication, all authors, including authors
                of invited papers, are required to pay the article processing
                charges to partially cover the cost of publication. Peer review
                of your manuscript is provided as a service. Authors should note
                that the manuscript will be withheld from publication, including
                &quot;Advance Publication&quot;, until the payment is completed.
                If the payment cannot be confirmed within one year, the
                manuscript will be rejected and the IEICE Transactions will not
                accept any manuscript written by any of the authors for one year
                or less as a penalty. For the Special Section, the period of
                payment will be shortened.
              </p>
              <p>
                The article processing charges will be calculated on the basis
                of the format (LaTeX or Word) of the electronic source files.
                The use of the IEICE LaTeX style file incurs a lower article
                processing charge than the use of the Word format. Because files
                cannot be changed after a &quot;Receipt of Manuscript&quot;
                e-mail is sent to the author, using the IEICE LaTeX style file
                at the time of submission is recommended to authors who desire a
                lower article processing charge.

                Transactions on Communications is currently taking the fixed
                charge system, which does not increase the article processing
                charge even if the number of pages increases, except for a PAPER
                having 16 more pages with the permission from the Editorial
                Board.

                As part of our effort to support IEICE Overseas Members residing
                in Asia (except Republic of Korea, Taiwan, China and Singapore),
                Africa, Central America, and South America, the Overseas
                Membership Development Program (OMDP) provides a discount on
                article processing charges. For details on eligibility for each
                membership grade, please refer to Provisions of Overseas
                Membership Development Program (OMDP). If the first author of a
                manuscript meets the requirements of the OMDP, the article
                processing charges will be reduced by 60% at the authors
                request. Furthermore, if the first author is an Overseas Student
                Member, the article processing charges will be reduced by 80%.
                Any authors who wish to apply for the discount must submit a
                written request to the OMDP. The discount will only be
                considered for manuscripts of which the electronic version is
                submitted in the format specified by the IEICE LaTeX style file
                provided by the IEICE. Failure to follow any of the above
                procedures will disqualify the applicant from receiving the
                discount, and full payment of the article processing charges
                will be requested.
              </p>
              <p>
                NOTE: Because of the recent rapid economic development of China

                the IEICE Overseas Membership Development Program (OMDP) are no
                longer accepted as of April 2011. (The OMDP discount on article
                processing charges is not provided to author(s) whose manuscript
                was submitted after April 1, 2011 (JST).) Also note that the

                translated into another language or when any portion of the
                manuscript is to be submitted to another publication, authors
                must register the action with the IEICE, and the original

              <ol>
                <li>
                  Originality: Has/Have the author(s) contributed original work
                  that has added new information or knowledge to previous work?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Practicality: Are the results useful from an academic or
                  industrial viewpoint?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Reliability: Are the results reliable from the readers’
                  viewpoint?

                For POSITION PAPERs, only papers having the significant
                feature(s) defined in Section 1.1.1 will be accepted, although
                comprehensive evaluations of performance or effectiveness will
                not be required.

              <p>
                Taking the judgments of the reviewers into consideration, the
                Editorial Committee will make one of the following decisions
                regarding PAPERS and WRITTEN DISCUSSIONS.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Acceptance:
                  <br />
                  The manuscript is accepted if it meets the overall criteria
                  described in Section 7.1,and is judged to be of interest to
                  the readers of IEICE Transactions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Conditional acceptance:
                  <br />
                  The manuscript is conditionally accepted if it, in its present
                  form, does not meet the overall criteria described in Section
                  7.1, but is judged to be capable of meeting them with
                  revision. The conditional acceptance is made only once, and a
                  revised manuscript (described below) that fails to satisfy the
                  conditions will be rejected.

              <p>
                A revised manuscript must be resubmitted within 60 days of the
                date of acknowledgement of Conditional Acceptance. If the 60
                days limit is exceeded, and there are no extenuating
                circumstances, then the manuscript will be considered as a new
                submission. The time limit may be shortened for Special Sections
                (Special Issues). The author(s) must attach an accompanying
                letter to the Associate Editor indicating how they have revised
                the manuscript in accordance with the Reviewer’s and Associate
                Editor’s comments.
              </p>
              <p>
                NOTE : When revising the manuscript, be aware of the following.

              <ul>

                  When the authors make any additions or corrections, the
                  section(s) must be marked so that the Reviewer can clearly
                  identify the changes made.

                <li>
                  As a rule, no change in the list of authors is permitted. If
                  authors would like to change the list of authors, the authors
                  must withdraw their submitted paper in accordance with 7.5
                  Withdrawal of Submission. Then the authors must resubmit the
                  modified paper as a new paper along with a revised form of
                  “Copyright Transfer and Article Processing Charge Agreement”
                  after changing the list of authors.

                  The manuscript is rejected if it does not meet the overall
                  criteria described in Section 7.1 and would require major
                  revisions with excessive editing, or if the subject matter is

                when submitting a revised version of such a manuscript. Upon
                resubmission, the authors are encouraged to provide the previous

              </h3>
              <p>
                Authors should not withdraw their submitted papers because
                withdrawal wastes the voluntary efforts of the associate editor
                and reviewers. However, the withdrawal of a submitted paper will
                be accepted if the authors can present unavoidable reasons.
                Authors must follow the procedures shown below when they
                withdraw their submitted papers.
              </p>

                    an attached scanned PDF file or by FAX to the IEICE
                    Transactions Section before the notification of acceptance
                    for publication. The withdrawal request letter must include
                    the following information.
                  </p>
                  <p>(a) Paper number</p>
                  <p>(b) Paper title</p>

                  <p>(d) Reason(s) why the paper must be withdrawn</p>
                  <p>
                    (e) Date and signatures of all the authors (or signature of

              <p>
                If only the contact author signs the letter, he/she must obtain
                the agreement of withdrawal from all the other authors and the
                letter must include the statement that all the other authors
                agree to the withdrawal.

                    After the paper is accepted for publication, withdrawal is
                    not permitted, in principle. The authors must pay the
                    article processing charge even when withdrawal is permitted.

                    The Editor-in-Chief of the Transactions decides whether
                    withdrawal is allowable or not. The IEICE Transactions
                    Section will send the authors notice of the decision of the
                    Editor-in-Chief. If the authors do not receive any reply
                    from the IEICE Transactions Section, they must send an
                    inquiry about the withdrawal to the office.

                    Any request of withdrawal that does not follow the above
                    procedure is treated as invalid. If illegal submission,
                    e.g., plagiarized or duplicate submission, is found for a
                    paper, the withdrawal of the paper will not be permitted and
                    the authors will be penalized accordingly.
