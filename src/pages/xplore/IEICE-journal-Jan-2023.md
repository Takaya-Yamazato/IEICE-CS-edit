In the January issue of the IEICE Journal, the CS Society page featured an article titled "The English Transactions of the Communications Society (EB and ComEX) will change the publication site from J-Stage to IEEE Xplore."

Yukari Tsuji, President of the Communications Society, wrote the piece with Makoto Taromaru, Chair, CS Editorial Board, and Takaya Yamazato, Designated Director, CS Journal Publication.

You can now access the article for free at the following URL: https://www.journal.ieice.org/bin/pdf_link.php?fname=k106_1_76&lang=J&year=2023; it explains that both IEICE Transactions on Communications and IEICE Communications Express (ComEX) will be published on IEEE Xplore.

It's worth noting that when the article was originally written, EB and ComEX were not available on J-STAGE.
However, following negotiations with IEEE, they are now available on both IEEE Xplore and J-STAGE.

The authors apologize for any confusion this may have caused.
