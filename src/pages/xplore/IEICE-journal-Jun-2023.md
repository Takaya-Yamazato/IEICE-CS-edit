The article "[Internationalization Strategy of the Communication Society: From IEEE Xplore to the Next Stage of Internationalization](https://www.journal.ieice.org/bin/pdf_link.php?fname=k106_6_523&lang=J&year=2023)" by Prof. Shoji Kasahara, the 2023 President of the IEICE Communication Society, was published in the [June issue of the IEICE Journal](https://www.journal.ieice.org). The article introduces the background of the change in the paper publication platform to IEEE Xplore for two of the Communication Society's English journals and the future development of the Communication Society's internationalization stage.

Prof. Kasahara argues that the Communication Society needs to increase the number of papers published in English journals to become an international society. He also states that changing the IEEE Xplore publication platform is essential to achieving this goal.

Prof. Kasahara identifies three critical points for the future development of the Communication Society's internationalization stage:

- Increase the number of papers published in the Communication Society's English journals.
- Promote participation in international conferences. Such include the Communication Society's flagship conference, ICETC.
- The Communication Society will be a platform for researchers from Japan and abroad to interact in a multi-layered way.

Through these efforts, Prof. Kasahara hopes the Communication Society will become an internationally recognized research society.
