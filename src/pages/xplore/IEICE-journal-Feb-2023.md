The February issue of the IEICE Journal features an article by Prof. Makoto Taromaru, Chair, CS Editorial Board of the Communications Society.

The article, titled "Revision of Publication Fees for Communications Society English Transactions and Letters ComEX due to Change of Publication Site," can be accessed for free at https://www.journal.ieice.org/bin/pdf_link.php?fname=k106_2_165&lang=J&year=2023.

In the piece, Dr. Taromaru explains the revision of publication fees for EB and ComEX following the move to IEEE Xplore as their new publication site.
