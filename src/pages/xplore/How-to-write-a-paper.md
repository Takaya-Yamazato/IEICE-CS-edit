The IEICE Communications Society is lecturing on writing papers at the 2023 IEICE General Conference.
The aim is to provide members with a broad and deep understanding of the best practices for writing papers.

This lecture has been a regular feature at the General Conference and Society Conference since March 2009 and has been well received by many participants.

Former editor-in-chief and vice editor-in-chief of the IEICE Transactions on Communications will give the lectures, making it a valuable opportunity to learn about the key points of writing papers.

The lecture is open to anyone interested in writing papers for universities or companies.

Additionally, the IEICE Transactions on Communications (EB) and IEICE Communications Express (ComEX) will now be published in IEEE Xplore, and this will also be explained in the lecture.

The lecture, titled "How to Write a Paper," will take place on Wednesday, March 8, 2023, from 9:40 to 11:45.

The program includes four sessions:

- (1) "How to write a paper" by Takeshi Ogawa (Tokyo Denki Univ.),
- (2) "Key Points for Writing English Papers" by Eiji Okamoto (Nagoya Institute of Technology),
- (3) "How to Write Responses and Letters" by Hiroaki Morino (Shibaura Institute of Technology), and
- (4) "English Transactions of Communications Society (EB and ComEX) will also be published in IEEE Xplore" by Takaya Yamazato (Nagoya University).

The lecture has a capacity of 100 persons, and admission is free.

We look forward to seeing you there.
