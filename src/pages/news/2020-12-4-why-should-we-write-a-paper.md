My name is Takaya Yamazato from Nagoya University. I am the editor-in-chief of the Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers (IEICE) Communication Society.

When I am pondering various ideas, I run into questions about what a paper is, why we write papers, what editing is, and so on.
I would like to share my thoughts on the purpose of a paper.

Why write a journal paper? Letâ€™s put it bluntly. It is all about the transfer of research and technology.

We refer to books as the source of knowledge, and a journal is kind of book comprising a compilation of findings in a specialized field.

So why should it be inherited?
Good knowledge is only meaningful if it is passed on.

We stand, and accumulate new knowledge on the shoulders of giants. In this way, we pass on our knowledge to the next generation of engineers and researchers. The source of this knowledge is the journal paper.

The role of an editor is to ensure that what is written in a paper is correct, verifiable, and understood. An editor also organizes and publishes said paper so that it can be widely read, and, then, archives it for future rediscovery.

With this in mind, it is no exaggeration to say that the IEICE Transactions on Communication will create the future of the field of communications.

Now, ladies and gentlemen, for the next generation of engineers and researchers, and the future of communications, let's submit a paper.
