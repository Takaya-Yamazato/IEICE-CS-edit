The IEICE Communication Society Editorial Board is pleased to announce the launch of a new initiative to encourage authors of outstanding papers to present their papers at international and technical committee conferences organized by the IEICE Communication Society. This initiative aims to increase the number of presentations at research meetings, international conferences, and workshops by strengthening the collaboration between the Technical Committee and the Editorial Board. It also aims to help authors of outstanding papers to develop their research by providing them with opportunities to present their work.  

The secret target of this system is authors living overseas. Those who live overseas may submit papers but have no opportunity to present them at research meetings. By providing these people with opportunities to present their papers at our conferences, we hope to make them aware of our proud research society. Also, we would like them to know about our community by allowing them to present their papers at our international conferences. In this way, we believe that people will naturally become familiar with the IEICE Communication Society, eventually leading to overseas members' acquisition.
