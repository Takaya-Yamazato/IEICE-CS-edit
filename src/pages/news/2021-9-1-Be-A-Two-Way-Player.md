Do you know that many of the active members of the IEICE Communication Society are two-way players, like Shohei Ohtani?

We are not only members of IEICE but also members of IEEE.
We believe that belonging to both societies allows us to learn the unique essence of each, which is the starting point for originality and excellence in our research.

I know it sounds like a clich√©, but diversity is the key to outstanding results.

Let me briefly introduce the activities of IEICE Communication Society.

IEICE has its roots in 1914 and is the oldest society in Asia.
IEICE is Japan's most prominent international academic society in electronics, information, and communications.

- [Overview of IEICE](https://www.ieice.org/global/history.html)

The Communication Society started in 1995 and is in charge of the communication field of IEICE.

As a sister society of ComSoc, we technically support some of ComSoc's conferences.

These conferences are supported by our Technical Committee.

The Technical Committee also holds conferences in Japan on a regular basis.

Publishing online monthly (EB, JB, and ComEX) and quarterly (Bplus), our journals are interested in the best research from across the field of communication engineering. A team of top researchers makes all editorial decisions.

Thanks to the QR code, you may have reached this page by the two-dimensional code pattern.  
[QR code was registered as an IEEE Milestone in 2020.](https://spectrum.ieee.org/how-a-board-game-and-skyscrapers-inspired-the-development-of-the-qr-code)

And "Konnichiwa" is a Japanese word meaning "Hello."

It seems that there is a seed of new research lurking in Japan.

How about being a two-way player?
