Thank you very much for your contribution to the editorial activities of Communications Society for a long time.
We regret that we could not hold the meeting face-to-face due to the Covid-19 disaster. In particular, I regret that we could not have a social gathering at all.
I would like to plan a reunion when things settle down.

I wish you all the best in your future endeavors.
