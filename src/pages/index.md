  text: The IEICE Transactions on Communications originates from the IEICE
    Transactions (Japanese language) that started in 1918, and took the current
    form in 1991 as one of the four English-language Transactions.  It receives
    about 600 paper-submissions every year, of which over 60 percent come from
    countries outside Japan. Among those contributions, only high quality and
    outstanding papers are published on a monthly basis. The peer-review process
    is careful but yet efficient; it typically takes less than 12 months from
    submission to publication.

  text: IEICE Communications Express (ComEX) is a peer-reviewed online letter
    journal published by the Institute of Electronics, Information and
    Communication Engineers (IEICE) and edited by the IEICE Communications
    Society. ComEX covers the entire field of communications. ComEX is a medium
    where researchers provide and exchange new topics easily and in a timely
    manner. Materials contained in the first several years will be freely

  text: The IEICE Transactions (Japanese language) is the oldest transaction in
    Asia that started in 1918.  From the beginning, communication engineering
    was a popular research field in the journal. Since then, the IEICE
    Transactions on Communications (JB) has been publishing excellent technical
    and research papers in communication engineering with leading researchers in
    the field as editorial board members. All papers have been reviewed by the
    editorial board of the journal and accepted for publication.

    Communications Society of IEICE  has been providing its members with
    information in electronics, information, and communications through papers,
    technical reports, books, and journals (the current journal). Although the
    magazine refers to the IEEE Society Magazine, the committee will not be
    bound by it but will vigorously discuss new concepts and deliver them to
    you.
