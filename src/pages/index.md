  text: The IEICE Transactions on Communications originates from the IEICE
    Transactions (Japanese language) that started in 1917, and took the current
    form in 1991 as one of the four English-language Transactions.  It receives
    about 600 paper-submissions every year, of which over 60 percent come from
    countries outside Japan. Among those contributions, only high quality and
    outstanding papers are published on a monthly basis. The peer-review process
    is careful but yet efficient; it typically takes less than 12 months from
    submission to publication.

  text: IEICE Communications Express (ComEX) is a peer-reviewed online letter
    journal published by the Institute of Electronics, Information and
    Communication Engineers (IEICE) and edited by the IEICE Communications
    Society. ComEX covers the entire field of communications. ComEX is a medium
    where researchers provide and exchange new topics easily and in a timely
    manner. Materials contained in the first several years will be freely
    available for anyone to read, download, or print from the journal web site.

  text: In May 1917, the Institute of Telegraph and Telephone Engineers of Japan
    was founded to study the science and art of telegraphy and telephony,
    exchanging relevant knowledge and promoting related industries.  The
    institute published the first journal in June 1917, the oldest
    telecommunication journal in Asia. Communication engineering was a popular
    research field from the beginning.  In 1987 the institute changed its name
    to the "Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers"
    (IEICE).  The IEICE Transactions on Communications (JB) has been publishing
    excellent technical and research papers in communication engineering with
    leading researchers in the field as editorial board members.  All articles
    have been reviewed by the editorial board of the journal and accepted for
    publication.

  text: The IEICE Communications Society Magazine (IEICE Bplus) publishes
    easy-to-understand articles targeting students who aspire to work in
    telecommunications and engineers in companies close to the field.  In
    addition to purely technical issues, the magazine also includes articles on
    the international standardization of technologies and new fields that
    integrate social perspectives. The editorial committee plans these papers
    and articles, of course, but we also accept active contributions from our
    members.
