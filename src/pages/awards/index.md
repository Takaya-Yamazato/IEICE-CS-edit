# Journal Information

In May 1917, the Institute of Telegraph and Telephone Engineers of Japan was founded to study the science and art of telegraphy and telephony, exchanging relevant knowledge and promoting related industries.  The institute published the first journal in June 1917, the oldest telecommunication journal in Asia. Communication engineering was a popular research field from the beginning.  In 1987 the institute changed its name to the "Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers" (IEICE).  The IEICE Transactions on Communications (JB) has been publishing excellent technical and research papers in communication engineering with leading researchers in the field as editorial board members.  All papers have been reviewed by the editorial board of the journal and accepted for publication.

## Single origin

Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known geographic origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a specific collection of beans from a single country. The name of the coffee is then usually the place it was grown to whatever degree available.

### Sustainable farming

Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.

#### Direct sourcing

Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some coffee roasters. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and incentivize quality.

##### Reinvest profits

We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing coffee to you. Thatâ€™s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our coffee is grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about coffee farming on our blog.
