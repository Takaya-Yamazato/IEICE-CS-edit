## About Paper Awards

The Communications Society established the Communications Society Excellent Paper Award in 2006 to select and award up to 11 outstanding papers per year in each category.  

We also nominate three papes for the IEICE Best Paper Award.
The IEICE Best Paper Award is given to three papers each year for the best papers published in the Society's journals.

We highly recommend all members (regular members) of the Communications Society to nominate papers for the prize.
