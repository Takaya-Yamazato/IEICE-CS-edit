Taromaru-sensei, thank you for the introduction.

My name is Takaya Yamazato from Nagoya University.
I'm the editor-in-chief of the IEICE Communication Society.
On behalf of the editorial board, I would like to extend my greetings to the organizing committee of ICETC 2020 and the invited speakers of the special session, and all the participants.

You may be surprised that our invited speakers are leaders in the field of communication engineering.   Not to mention Professor Adachi, all the other invited speakers are the authors of last year's best-paper-awards. They will be presenting some of the communication society's best research and development.
 I'm very much looking forward to hearing hints behind their research and development that have not been written in their papers.
It is also a good opportunity for the audience to ask questions directly to the award-winners. Please feel free to ask lots of questions.

Now, let me share my slide.

When I'm pondering various ideas, I run into questions about what a paper is, why we write papers, what editing is, and so on.

I would like to share my thoughts on the paper.
Why write a journal paper? Let's put it bluntly. 
It's all about the transfer of research and technology. 

We refer to books as the source of knowledge, and a journal is a compilation of findings in a specialized field. 

So why should it be inherited? 
Good knowledge is only meaningful if it is passed on. 

We stand on the shoulders of giants, and we accumulate new knowledge on the shoulders of giants. In this way, we pass on the knowledge to the next generation of engineers and researchers. 
The source of this is the journal paper. 

The role of editing is to ensure that what is written in the paper is correct, verifiable, and understood. It also organizes and publishes the paper so that it can be widely read. And then accumulate them for future rediscovery. 

With this in mind, it is no exaggeration to say that the IEICE Transaction on Communication will create the future of communications.

Now, ladies and gentlemen, for the next generation of engineers and researchers and the future of communications, let's submit a paper. 

We plan two special sections on ICETC 2020 for you.
IEICE Transactions on Communications and IEICE Communication Express (ComEX).
We look forward to receiving your submissions.
